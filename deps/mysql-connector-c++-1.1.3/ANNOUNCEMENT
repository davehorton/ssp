Dear MySQL Users,

A new GA (general availability) version of MySQL Connector/C++ has been made available: MySQL Connector/C++ 1.1.2 GA. The MySQL Connector/C++ provides a C++ API for
connecting client applications to the MySQL Server 5.1 or newer. You can download the production release at:

 http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/1.1.html

The MySQL driver for C++ offers an easy to use API derived from JDBC 4.0. MySQL Workbench is using it successfully since years. 

The major changes in 1.1.2 are:

- Expired password support. Connection options
  OPT_CAN_HANDLE_EXPIRED_PASSWORDS(bool, application can deal with expired
  passwords), and preInit(string, commands to run prior to driver
  initialization commands) have been introduced. (Bug#15936764/67325)

- postInit connection string has been introduced. Similar to preInit, but
  commands are run after driver's initialization.

- Statement::executeUpdate can now execute multiple statements.
  CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS connection option still has to be selected.
  getUpdateCount will return data for the last executed statement.

- Built against libmysql 5.6.10

You can find further details, including usages examples, in the documentation at:
